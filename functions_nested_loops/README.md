0. Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

The program should return 0
1. Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code
2. Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_alphabet-x10(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code
3. Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Returns 1 if c is lowercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islower to learn more.
4. Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isalpha. Run man isalpha to learn more.

5. Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

6. Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

7. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

8. Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

9. Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

10. Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

11. Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
